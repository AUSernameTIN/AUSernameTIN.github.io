        <p>A ripe banana is yellow (with some brown spots) and just starting to soften, but it still holds its shape. At
            that stage, it's just right for a fruit salad because it won't get mushy. The more brown speckles, the riper
            the bananas, the sweeter they'll be!</p>

        <p>Let the bananas ripen (and overripen) at room temperature. Depending on the weather, this could take a few
            days, or up to a week. The best bananas for banana bread aren't yellow; they're black. Or they're at least
            streaked with black/brown, with just the barest hint of green at the stem</p>
