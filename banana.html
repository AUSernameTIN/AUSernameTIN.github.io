<p>A ripe banana is yellow (with some brown spots) and just starting to soften, but it still holds its shape. At that stage, it's just right for a fruit salad because it won't get mushy. The more brown speckles, the riper the bananas, the sweeter they'll be!</p>
<h1>How to know when bananas are ready for Banana Bread!</h1>
<h1>Let the bananas ripen (and overripen) at room temperature. Depending on the weather, this could take a few days, or up to a week. The best bananas for banana bread aren't yellow; they're black. Or they're at least streaked with black/brown, with just the barest hint of green at the stem</h1>
